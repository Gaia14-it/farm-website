            Buchanan Community Schools is one of just a handful of public K-12 districts in the state of Michigan that has its own <span class="bold">farm</span>! The 32-acre school farm currently hosts hands-on learning opportunities for Buchanan Community School students in grades <span class="bold">kindergarten through fourth grade</span>. From planting seeds, harvesting pumpkins, tapping maple trees, building scarecrows, and composting, students use <span class="bold">real-world applications</span> to not only master Michigan Science Standards but also to learn <span class="bold">life skills</span> that can be tapped into during their future years.
